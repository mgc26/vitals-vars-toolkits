## Standard Operating Procedures

### Daily Operations Rhythm

#### Shift Huddles (0700, 1500, 1900, 2300)
**Duration**: 15 minutes
**Attendees**: Command center team + unit representatives

**Agenda**:
1. Current state (2 min)
2. Anticipated challenges (3 min)
3. Discharge pipeline (3 min)
4. Staffing adjustments (3 min)
5. Action items (4 min)

#### Continuous Monitoring Activities
1. **Boarding Surveillance**: Review every 30 minutes
2. **Predictive Alerts**: Respond within 5 minutes
3. **Capacity Matching**: Ongoing optimization
4. **Escalation Management**: Per protocol

### Key Workflows

#### ED Admission Workflow
```
ED requests admission → Command Center receives alert
↓
CC identifies optimal bed based on:
- Clinical needs
- Staffing levels  
- Geographic efficiency
- Predicted discharge timing
↓
CC coordinates with unit → Assigns bed
↓
CC monitors transfer → Ensures timely movement
```

#### Discharge Acceleration Workflow
```
Discharge order placed → CC receives notification
↓
CC initiates parallel processes:
- Transport queued
- Housekeeping notified
- Pharmacy alerted for meds
- Family notification
↓
CC tracks completion → Bed ready for next patient
```

### Escalation Protocols

| Situation | Trigger | Action | Escalation |
|-----------|---------|--------|------------|
| ED Boarding | >10 patients boarding >2h | Surge protocol | Administrator |
| No Beds Available | 0 beds in needed service | Overflow protocol | Chief Medical Officer |
| Staffing Crisis | <80% target staffing | Emergency staffing | Chief Nursing Officer |

# FCOTS Implementation Guide

## 90-Day Roadmap to 85% First-Case On-Time Starts

### Week 1-2: Baseline & Buy-in

**Day 1-3: Measure Current State**
- [ ] Run SQL query #1 to calculate current FCOTS %
- [ ] Identify your top 5 delay reasons using query #2
- [ ] Calculate financial impact with query #7
- [ ] Take screenshots of worst-performing days

**Day 4-5: Build Your Coalition**
- [ ] Present data to OR director, nursing supervisor, anesthesia chief
- [ ] Get surgeon champion (ideally one who's always on time)
- [ ] Schedule kickoff with C-suite—lead with the $$$ slide

**Day 6-10: Set Up Measurement**
- [ ] Create automated daily FCOTS report (use provided SQL)
- [ ] Build surgeon scorecard dashboard
- [ ] Establish data collection for delay reasons if not already tracked

### Week 3-4: Quick Wins

**Implement "Night Before" Protocol**
```
18:00 - Charge RN reviews tomorrow's first cases
18:30 - Missing items escalated to on-call team  
19:00 - Email confirmation: "All rooms ready"
06:30 - Final check by first-shift charge
```

**Launch Daily Huddle**
- Time: 14:00 (or 2 hours before OR close)
- Duration: 15 minutes max
- Attendees: OR charge, pre-op charge, anesthesia rep
- Agenda:
  1. Today's FCOTS % (30 seconds)
  2. Tomorrow's red flags (5 minutes)
  3. Process improvements (remainder)

### Week 5-8: Major Interventions

**Deploy First-Case Facilitator Role**
- Assign one RN as "morning champion"
- Arrives 30 min early
- Owns patient readiness checklist
- Has authority to call surgeons at T-15

**Surgeon Engagement**
- Week 5: Baseline scorecard goes live (no names yet)
- Week 6: Individual reports via secure email
- Week 7: Lounge leaderboard launches
- Week 8: Announce incentive structure (if approved)

**Technology Enablers**
- Text alerts at T-30 for late surgeons
- iPad dashboard in pre-op showing readiness
- Auto-generated "first case risk report" at 16:00

### Week 9-12: Sustain & Scale

**Reinforce What's Working**
- Double down on interventions showing results
- Kill what's not moving the needle
- Add resources to bottlenecks

**Celebrate Success**
- Pizza party for first week hitting 85%
- Surgeon of the month parking spot
- Share wins in medical staff meeting

**Plan Phase 2**
- Add turnover time as next metric
- Expand to all cases, not just first
- Link to patient satisfaction scores

### Common Pitfalls & Fixes

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "Surgeons won't engage" | Start with allies, let peer pressure build |
| "It's always anesthesia" | Joint huddle, shared accountability |
| "Our EMR can't track this" | Manual audit 1 week/month until IT catches up |
| "Staff turnover killed momentum" | Hardwire into orientation, job descriptions |
| "We hit 85% then slipped" | Monthly review required indefinitely |

### Resources Needed

**People**
- Executive sponsor (CNO or COO)
- Project manager (0.5 FTE for 90 days)
- Data analyst (few hours/week)
- First-case facilitator (1.0 FTE)

**Technology**
- Dashboard tool (Tableau, Power BI, or Excel)
- Text messaging system
- EMR report writing access

**Budget Estimate**
- First-case facilitator: $75K/year
- Dashboard setup: $5-10K one-time
- Incentives: $20-50K/year
- **ROI: 3-6 months at most hospitals**

### Measurement Plan

**Weekly Metrics**
- FCOTS % (overall and by surgeon)
- Average delay when late
- Delay reason breakdown

**Monthly Metrics**
- OR overtime hours
- Patient satisfaction (first cases)
- Staff satisfaction survey

**Quarterly Metrics**
- Financial impact vs. baseline
- Case volume growth
- Market share for mornings

### Sample Communication Templates

**Surgeon Email (Week 6)**
```
Dr. [Name],

Your first-case on-time performance last month: 72%
Department average: 68%
Target: 85%

Your top delay reason: Equipment not ready (8 cases)

How we can help: Reply with your preference card updates

```

**Text Alert (T-30)**
```
Good morning Dr. [Name]! 
Room 5 is ready for your 7:30 case.
Patient Jones is in pre-op.
Current time: 7:00 AM
```

**Huddle Agenda Email**
```
FCOTS Huddle - [Date] 14:00

Yesterday: 78% (↑ from 72% last week)

Tomorrow's Risks:
- Room 3: Special equipment arriving AM
- Room 7: Complex patient, start pre-op early
- Dr. Smith first case after vacation

Process Topic: Holiday schedule planning
```

### Success Metrics by Day 90

- [ ] FCOTS ≥ 85% for 2 consecutive weeks
- [ ] Surgeon engagement > 90%
- [ ] Delay documentation > 95% complete
- [ ] Positive ROI demonstrated
- [ ] Phase 2 plan approved

### Need Help?

Common questions:
- EMR integration issues → Start manual, automate later
- Surgeon pushback → Use data, not emotion
- Resource constraints → Pilot in 3 rooms first

Remember: Perfect is the enemy of good. Start somewhere, iterate weekly.

# Discharge by Noon Toolkit

## Quick Start Guide

This toolkit contains everything you need to improve your discharge-by-noon (DBN) rate from 20% to 40% in 90 days. Start with the SQL queries to establish your baseline, then follow the implementation guide.

## What's Included

### üìä SQL Queries (`/sql/`)
- **discharge_timing_analysis.sql** - Core queries for tracking DBN metrics
- **discharge_barriers_tracking.sql** - Advanced queries for barrier analysis and process optimization

### üêç Python Analytics (`/python/`)
- **discharge_analysis.py** - Comprehensive analysis tool for discharge patterns
- **discharge_predictor.py** - Machine learning model to predict next-day discharges
- **roi_calculator.py** - Calculate financial impact and ROI of DBN improvements
- **requirements.txt** - Python package dependencies

### üìà Dashboard Templates (`/dashboards/`)
- **tableau_dbn_dashboard.md** - Complete Tableau implementation guide
- **powerbi_dbn_dashboard.md** - Step-by-step Power BI dashboard creation

### üìã Implementation Guides (`/guides/`)
- **90_day_implementation_plan.md** - Detailed roadmap for DBN transformation
- **multidisciplinary_rounds_guide.md** - How to run effective morning rounds

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Establish Baseline (Day 1)
```sql
-- Run this query first to get your current DBN rate
SELECT 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM discharge_time) < 12 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / 
    COUNT(*) AS dbn_rate
FROM patient_encounters
WHERE discharge_time >= DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE())
```

### Step 2: Set Up Analytics (Week 1)
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r python/requirements.txt

# Run baseline analysis
python python/discharge_analysis.py

# Calculate ROI for your hospital
python python/roi_calculator.py
```

### Step 3: Build Dashboard (Week 1-2)
- Choose either Tableau or Power BI template
- Connect to your data sources
- Customize for your organization
- Share with stakeholders

### Step 4: Launch Pilot (Week 2)
- Select high-volume medical unit
- Implement morning rounds
- Track daily progress
- Address barriers real-time

## Key Files for Each Role

### For Executives
- Start with `roi_calculator.py` to see financial impact
- Review dashboard templates for KPI tracking
- Read executive summary in implementation plan

### For Project Managers  
- Follow `90_day_implementation_plan.md` step-by-step
- Use SQL queries for daily tracking
- Set up automated dashboards

### For Clinical Leaders
- Focus on `multidisciplinary_rounds_guide.md`
- Review barrier tracking queries
- Implement prediction model

### For Analysts
- Run all SQL queries to understand data
- Customize Python scripts for your needs
- Build and maintain dashboards

## Expected Outcomes

Based on implementations at similar hospitals:

**Month 1**: 
- Baseline established
- Pilot unit showing 5-10% improvement
- Key barriers identified

**Month 2**:
- DBN rate reaching 25-30%
- Multiple units engaged
- ROI becoming visible

**Month 3**:
- Achieving 35-40% DBN rate
- Sustained improvements
- Culture change evident

## Customization Guide

### Adapting SQL Queries
- Replace table names with your schema
- Adjust time zones if needed
- Add facility-specific fields

### Modifying Python Scripts
- Update financial parameters in ROI calculator
- Adjust prediction model features
- Customize visualizations

### Dashboard Modifications
- Add your branding
- Include additional metrics
- Create role-specific views

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Our DBN rate isn't improving"**
- Check if rounds are happening consistently
- Verify barrier resolution timeline
- Ensure physician engagement

**"The predictions aren't accurate"**
- Retrain model with your data
- Add facility-specific features
- Validate data quality

**"Staff aren't engaged"**
- Share success stories
- Show financial impact
- Recognize high performers

## Support Resources

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: "The 10 AM Wall"

**Solution:** 
- Assign specific owners in rounds
- 10 AM check-in call
- Visual management boards
- Accountability partners

### Pitfall 2: "Weekend Wasteland"
**Problem:** Weekend DBN drops to <10%
**Solution:**
- Friday afternoon weekend planning
- Saturday morning rounds (even virtual)

### Pitfall 3: "Data Fatigue"
**Problem:** Staff stop engaging with metrics
**Solution:**
- Simplify to 1-2 key metrics

- Rotate data presentation style

### Pitfall 4: "Physician Resistance"
**Problem:** "My patients are too complex"
**Solution:**
- Share physician-specific data
- Peer comparison (blinded)
- Start with simple patients
- Physician champion testimonials

## Quick Reference Cards

### Daily Huddle Script
```
"Good morning team. Let's review discharges.
For each patient, I need:
1. Ready today? (Yes/No)
2. If yes, what time?
3. If no, what's the barrier?
4. Who owns the barrier?
Let's start with bed 1..."

- **Ride needed**: Call by 9 AM
- **Meds not ready**: Pharmacy in rounds

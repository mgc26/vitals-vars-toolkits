# Multidisciplinary Rounds Guide for Discharge by Noon Success

## Overview
Effective multidisciplinary rounds are the cornerstone of achieving 40% discharge-by-noon rates. This guide provides a practical framework for implementing and optimizing morning rounds.

## The Evidence
Studies show that units with structured multidisciplinary rounds before 9 AM achieve:
- **41.2% DBN rate** vs 29.6% for control units
- **2-hour reduction** in average discharge time
- **30% fewer** discharge-related delays

## Round Structure

### Timing
- **Start Time**: 8:30 AM sharp (non-negotiable)
- **Duration**: 30 minutes maximum
- **Frequency**: Every day including weekends
- **Location**: Consistent spot near unit

### Required Participants
1. **Charge Nurse** - Leads the rounds
2. **Case Manager** - Owns discharge planning
3. **Hospitalist/Attending** - Medical decisions
4. **Pharmacist** - Medication reconciliation
5. **Therapy Services** - PT/OT clearance
6. **Unit Clerk** - Documentation support

*Virtual participation is acceptable for pharmacy and therapy*

## The 2-Minute Rule

Each patient discussion should take no more than 2 minutes:

### Minute 1: Status Check
- **Medical readiness**: Clear for discharge? (Yes/No)
- **Anticipated discharge date**: Today/Tomorrow/Later
- **Discharge disposition**: Home/SNF/Rehab/Other
- **Key clinical updates**: Overnight events, lab results

### Minute 2: Barrier Resolution
- **Identify barriers**: What's preventing discharge?
- **Assign ownership**: Who will resolve it?
- **Set deadline**: By what time?
- **Escalation plan**: What if it's not resolved?

## Pre-Round Preparation

### Night Shift Responsibilities (11 PM - 7 AM)
- Review all patients for discharge potential
- Flag top 3 likely discharges
- Complete preliminary documentation
- Ensure morning labs are ordered

### Charge Nurse Prep (7:30 - 8:30 AM)
- Print patient list with room numbers
- Review overnight reports
- Check lab results
- Identify coverage needs

## Round Execution Protocol

### 8:25 AM - Pre-Huddle
- Participants gather
- Quick staffing update
- Review yesterday's performance

### 8:30 AM - Round Start
```
Script: "Good morning team. We have [X] patients to review. 
Our goal is [Y] discharges by noon. Let's start with 
our predicted discharges from yesterday."
```

### Patient Review Order
1. **Confirmed discharges** - Quick status check
2. **Likely discharges** - Detailed barrier review  
3. **Possible discharges** - Assessment needed
4. **Complex cases** - Brief update only

### 9:00 AM - Round Completion
- Summarize discharge targets
- Confirm barrier owners
- Set 11 AM check-in time

## Barrier Resolution Framework

### Common Barriers and Solutions

| Barrier | Owner | Standard Solution | Timeline |
|---------|-------|-------------------|----------|
| Insurance auth pending | Case Manager | Call insurance by 9 AM | 2 hours |
| Ride not arranged | Social Work | Contact family/arrange transport | By 10 AM |
| Meds not ready | Pharmacy | Prioritize discharge meds | By 11 AM |
| Durable medical equipment | Case Manager | Use preferred vendor list | By 10 AM |
| Lab results pending | Charge Nurse | Call lab for STAT results | 1 hour |
| Family not available | Bedside Nurse | Call family night before | By 9 AM |
| Therapy clearance | PT/OT | Morning evaluation priority | By 10 AM |
| Physician order missing | Attending | Enter during rounds | Immediate |

## Communication Tools

### Visual Management Board
Create a unit board with:
- Patient magnets (Green = ready, Yellow = barriers, Red = not ready)
- Barrier categories with check boxes
- Hour-by-hour discharge schedule
- Yesterday's performance

### Discharge Readiness Indicators
**Green Light (Ready for discharge)**
- Medical clearance documented
- Disposition confirmed
- Transportation arranged
- Medications ready
- Education complete

**Yellow Light (Barriers exist)**
- 1-2 barriers identified
- Owner assigned
- Resolution in progress

**Red Light (Not ready)**
- Medical issues ongoing
- Multiple unresolved barriers
- Discharge unlikely today

## Role-Specific Responsibilities

### Charge Nurse
- Lead rounds daily
- Update visual board
- Escalate unresolved barriers
- Track hourly progress

### Case Manager
- Pre-screen all patients
- Coordinate post-acute needs
- Handle insurance issues
- Arrange equipment/services

### Hospitalist/Attending
- Round early on discharge patients
- Enter orders during rounds
- Make decisive disposition calls
- Support nursing decisions

### Pharmacist
- Join rounds (virtual OK)
- Prioritize discharge prescriptions
- Complete medication reconciliation
- Educate on complex regimens

### Bedside Nurse
- Prepare patients for discharge
- Complete education checklist
- Coordinate with family
- Execute discharge process

## Weekend Modification

### Saturday Rounds
- Start at 9:00 AM
- Focus on confirmed discharges only
- Virtual attendance acceptable
- 15-minute maximum duration

### Sunday Planning
- Review Monday discharges
- Complete weekend documentation
- Arrange Monday morning needs
- Prep discharge paperwork

## Measuring Success

### Daily Metrics
- Round start time
- Attendance rate
- Patients reviewed
- Barriers identified
- DBN achievement

### Weekly Analysis
- Barrier trends
- Provider patterns
- Unit comparison
- Time improvements

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Starting late** - Even 5 minutes matters
2. **Missing key players** - Decisions get delayed
3. **Over-discussing** - Stick to 2-minute rule
4. **No follow-up** - 11 AM check-in is crucial
5. **Accepting "maybe"** - Get definitive answers

## Quick Win Tips

1. **Use a timer** - Keeps discussions focused
2. **Stand up** - No sitting during rounds
3. **Assign scribes** - Rotate documentation duty
4. **Celebrate wins** - Announce noon discharges
5. **Learn from misses** - Quick debrief on delays

# Board of Directors: CEO AI Leadership Evaluation Guide

**Questions and criteria for boards evaluating CEO candidates or assessing current leadership for AI transformation**

## Purpose

This guide helps healthcare boards assess whether a CEO candidate or current CEO has the capabilities and commitment to lead AI transformation. Use it during:

- **CEO search and hiring processes**
- **Annual CEO performance reviews**
- **Strategic planning discussions about AI**
- **Succession planning**

The guide is organized into two sections:
1. **Interview questions** for assessing CEO candidates or current CEOs
2. **Observable evidence** to validate what CEOs say vs. what they do

## Section 2: Observable Evidence (For Current CEOs)

Boards should not rely solely on what CEOs say—observe what they do.

### Evidence of Digital Fluency

## Red Flags for Boards

**If 3+ of these are true, AI transformation is unlikely to succeed:**

- ❌ CEO tenure expectation <3 years or mandate is turnaround/caretaker
- ❌ CEO cannot explain how AI differs from traditional software or automation
- ❌ CEO treats AI as IT project and fully delegates to CIO without accountability
- ❌ No willingness to hire senior AI leader with authority and competitive compensation
- ❌ CEO not personally engaged with AI strategy or execution (fails The Monday Test)
- ❌ Organization has high turnover in technical/analytics roles
- ❌ AI initiatives have been stuck in pilot phase for 12+ months with no scaling plan
- ❌ CEO focuses exclusively on short-term financial metrics with no long-term transformation vision

**Board Action Required**: Intervene with CEO development plan, restructure AI leadership, or reconsider CEO fit for strategic mandate.

---

## Board Accountability Questions

**Boards should regularly ask themselves:**

1. **Are we holding the CEO accountable for AI progress?**
   - Is AI a standing board agenda item (not just when problems arise)?
   - Do we review AI metrics (adoption, ROI, risk) quarterly?
   - Have we tied CEO compensation to AI milestones?

2. **Have we provided the CEO with the mandate and resources to succeed?**
   - Have we approved multi-year AI investment?
   - Are we protecting AI investment during budget challenges?
   - Have we given CEO authority to make hard decisions (reallocating resources, changing workflows)?

3. **Do we have the expertise to oversee AI strategy?**
   - Does our board have directors with digital/AI expertise?
   - Do we ask informed questions, or just accept management presentations?
   - Have we engaged external advisors to validate AI strategy and risk management?

4. **Are we part of the problem?**
   - Are we pressuring CEO for short-term financial performance at the expense of AI investment?
   - Are we risk-averse in ways that block AI experimentation?
   - Are we reinforcing short CEO tenures that prevent transformation?

### For Current CEO
- [ ] Conduct annual CEO AI leadership assessment (see CEO AI Readiness Assessment)
- [ ] Implement The Monday Test and review quarterly results
- [ ] Include AI milestones in CEO performance goals and compensation
- [ ] Provide support (executive coaching, board expertise, resources) to address gaps

### Board Development
- [ ] Recruit board members with healthcare AI/digital expertise
- [ ] Educate full board on AI strategy and risk (annual board retreat or workshop)
- [ ] Establish board Technology or AI Committee if not already in place
- [ ] Engage external advisors to validate AI strategy and governance

## Case Study: Board Intervention That Worked

**Scenario**: Mid-sized health system, CEO in role for 2 years. AI was strategic priority on paper, but no progress.

**Board Assessment**:
- CEO was operationally strong but lacked AI fluency (Score: 2/5)
- AI governance was weak: no CAIO, IT-led AI with no clinical engagement
- The Monday Test revealed CEO spent <1 hour/month on AI

**Board Intervention**:
1. Candid conversation with CEO: "AI is strategic, and you're not leading it. What do you need?"
2. CEO acknowledged gaps and requested support
3. Board funded executive AI coaching program (6 months)
4. Board required hiring of Chief AI Officer reporting to CEO (approved budget)
5. Board added AI milestones to CEO annual goals with compensation tied to progress
6. Board recruited director with healthcare AI expertise to strengthen oversight

**Outcome**:
- CEO increased engagement (Monday Test scores 12+/20)
- CAIO hired within 3 months
- AI governance established
- 3 AI use cases moved from pilot to production in 12 months
- Board confidence restored; CEO contract extended

**Lesson**: CEOs often want to lead AI but lack fluency or support. Boards can provide both—or recognize when CEO is wrong fit.

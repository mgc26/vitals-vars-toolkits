# CEO AI Readiness Assessment

**A 5-dimension framework for evaluating healthcare executive capacity for AI transformation**

## Purpose

This assessment evaluates whether a healthcare CEO has the capabilities, commitment, and organizational design thinking required to scale AI adoption. Use it for:

- CEO candidate evaluation during hiring
- Annual performance reviews of current leadership
- Leadership development planning
- Board-level strategic planning discussions

## Scoring Guide

**Each dimension is scored 1-5:**

- **5 = Exemplary**: Best-in-class capability; clear evidence of mastery
- **4 = Strong**: Above-average capability; some evidence of effectiveness
- **3 = Adequate**: Baseline capability; inconsistent execution
- **2 = Developing**: Aware of need but lacks capability or track record
- **1 = Absent**: No evidence of capability or awareness

**Target scores for AI transformation:**
- **Overall score of 20+** (out of 25): Ready to lead AI transformation
- **18-19**: Capable with targeted development
- **15-17**: Requires significant capability building
- **<15**: High risk for AI transformation failure

## Appendix: Red Flags

**Immediate concerns that suggest CEO is wrong fit for AI transformation:**

- ❌ CEO cannot explain what AI is or how it differs from traditional software
- ❌ CEO tenure expectation <3 years or mandate is turnaround/caretaker
- ❌ No willingness to establish senior AI leadership role with authority
- ❌ Views AI as IT project rather than enterprise transformation
- ❌ Cannot compete for technical talent (compensation, culture, career development)
- ❌ No personal engagement with AI strategy or learning
- ❌ Delegates all AI decisions to lieutenants without accountability
- ❌ Treats AI as discretionary or experimental rather than strategic infrastructure

**If 3+ red flags are present, AI transformation is unlikely to succeed without leadership change.**

# The Monday Test: CEO AI Engagement Scorecard

**Weekly accountability framework for healthcare CEO AI leadership**

## Purpose

The Monday Test is a simple, weekly self-assessment for healthcare CEOs to ensure hands-on engagement with AI strategy and execution. It takes 5 minutes to complete and provides objective evidence of personal commitment.

**The core principle**: If AI is truly a strategic priority, the CEO should be able to answer these questions every week. If the answers are consistently "none" or "I don't know," AI is not actually a priority—it's performative.

## Interpretation Guide

### By Total Score

**16-20**: Exemplary engagement. CEO is personally driving AI transformation.

**12-15**: Strong engagement. AI is a real priority with consistent CEO involvement.

**10-11**: Adequate engagement. Meeting minimum bar but could increase commitment.

**6-9**: Insufficient engagement. AI is delegated rather than led. Risk of stalled transformation.

**0-5**: Absent engagement. AI is not actually a CEO priority despite stated commitments.

### By Category Patterns

**High Project Review + Low Decision-Making**: CEO is monitoring but not empowered or willing to act. May indicate lack of authority or confidence.

**High Communication + Low Learning**: CEO is championing AI without understanding it. Risk of uninformed decisions or loss of credibility.

**High Learning + Low Project Review**: CEO is personally interested but not operationally engaged. Transformation will stall.

**Low Leadership Engagement**: CEO is not building relationships with AI team. Risk of talent flight and organizational resistance.

## Accountability Mechanisms

### For CEOs (Self-Accountability)

- Complete scorecard every Monday morning (5 minutes)
- Review quarterly trends and adjust behavior
- Share results with Chief AI Officer or board committee for feedback

### For Boards (Oversight)

- Request quarterly Monday Test summaries in CEO performance reviews
- Discuss patterns: Is CEO engagement increasing or decreasing?
- Use as evidence of strategic commitment during annual planning

### For Chief AI Officers (Team Accountability)

- Compare CEO self-assessment with your observations
- If CEO scores are consistently high but AI is stalled, diagnose organizational barriers
- If CEO scores are consistently low, escalate to board or request explicit prioritization

---

## Red Flags

**If any of these patterns persist for 4+ weeks, AI transformation is at risk:**

- ❌ CEO consistently scores 0 in Project Review (not seeing the work)
- ❌ CEO consistently scores 0 in Decision-Making (not unblocking or deciding)
- ❌ CEO consistently scores 0 in Learning (not building fluency)
- ❌ Total score consistently <6 (AI is not a real priority)
- ❌ CEO delegates Monday Test completion to assistant or doesn't complete it (not personally accountable)

**Action Required**: Board should intervene, restructure AI leadership reporting, or reconsider CEO fit for transformation mandate.

---

## Implementation Tips

### Starting the Monday Test

**Week 1**: Just complete it. Don't judge yourself. Establish baseline.

**Weeks 2-4**: Identify patterns. Which categories are consistently low? Why?

**Weeks 5-8**: Set personal goals. If Decision-Making is low, commit to making 1 AI decision per week.

**Weeks 9+**: This should become routine. If it feels burdensome, AI isn't actually a priority.

### Making It Sustainable

- Block 15 minutes every Friday afternoon to reflect on the week
- Keep a running log of AI activities in your calendar or notes app
- Have your Chief AI Officer send you a weekly "CEO engagement summary" to jog your memory
- Share quarterly results with your board or executive team for accountability

### Avoiding Gaming the System

**The Monday Test is not a checklist to fake.** It's a mirror.

- Don't manufacture meetings just to score points
- Don't count passive activities (receiving emails) as engagement
- Don't delegate this to your chief of staff—you're assessing YOUR behavior
- If you're consistently scoring low, the solution isn't to game the test—it's to change your priorities or admit AI isn't strategic

## Case Study: How One CEO Used the Monday Test

**Context**: 300-bed community hospital, CEO committed to AI-driven operational efficiency

**Quarter 1 Results**: Average score 6/20. High on Communication (talking about AI in meetings) but low on Project Review and Decision-Making.

**Diagnosis**: CEO was championing AI but not operationally engaged. Projects stalled in committees waiting for decisions.

**Intervention**:
- Established weekly 30-minute AI project review every Tuesday
- Gave Chief AI Officer authority to request CEO decisions between meetings
- CEO set goal: make at least 1 AI decision per week

**Quarter 2 Results**: Average score 13/20. Project velocity increased. Talent retention improved (team felt CEO was invested).

**Lesson**: The Monday Test revealed a pattern the CEO wasn't aware of. Changing behavior changed outcomes.

---

**Remember**: The goal isn't to score 20/20 every week. The goal is to demonstrate consistent, meaningful engagement. If AI is truly strategic, it should be reflected in how you spend your time and attention.

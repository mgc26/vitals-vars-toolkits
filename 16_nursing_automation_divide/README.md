# Rural AI Readiness Toolkit

Practical tools for evaluating nursing automation products in resource-constrained environments.

## Contents

### 1. Rural AI Readiness Assessment
**File:** `guides/rural_ai_readiness_assessment.md`

A self-assessment checklist for rural and critical access hospitals to evaluate their infrastructure, staffing, and workflow readiness before implementing nursing automation. Identifies gaps that must be addressed or requirements that vendors must meet.

### 2. Vendor Evaluation Questions
**File:** `guides/vendor_evaluation_questions.md`

32 questions to ask AI vendors about rural deployment capabilities. Covers offline operation, legacy EHR integration, workforce turnover, safety layers, and implementation requirements. Use during RFP process or vendor demos.

### 3. Integration Requirements Matrix
**File:** `guides/integration_requirements_matrix.md`

Decision framework comparing cloud-dependent vs. edge/hybrid architectures and FHIR-based vs. legacy integration approaches. Helps match vendor capabilities to your specific infrastructure constraints.

## How to Use This Toolkit

1. **Start with the Readiness Assessment** to understand your current state and identify critical gaps
2. **Use the Vendor Questions** during evaluation to pressure-test rural deployment claims
3. **Apply the Integration Matrix** to match vendor architectures to your infrastructure reality

## Key Statistics Reference

| Metric | Rural/CAH | Urban | Gap |
|--------|-----------|-------|-----|
| Patient-to-nurse ratio | 7.3:1 | 4.8:1 | 52% more patients |
| Comprehensive EHR functionality | 32% | 65% | Half the capability |
| Routine interoperability | 36% | 47% | 11 point gap |
| Broadband at 100/20 Mbps | 72% | 97% | 25 point gap |
| Operating in the red | 46% | ~25% | Nearly 2x |

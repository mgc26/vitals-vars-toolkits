# 8-Week Prior Authorization Transformation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides a structured approach to transform your prior authorization operations from manual processing to intelligent automation, achieving 90%+ cost reduction.

## Week 1-2: Assessment & Baseline

### Objectives
- Establish current state metrics
- Identify quick wins
- Build stakeholder coalition

### Actions
1. **Run Baseline Analytics**
   ```sql
   -- Use pa_cost_analysis.sql to get current metrics
   -- Document: Total volume, cost per PA, manual percentage
   ```

2. **Provider Performance Analysis**
   ```sql
   -- Use provider_performance.sql to identify gold card candidates
   -- Target: Providers with >92% approval rate
   ```

3. **Stakeholder Engagement**
   - Medical directors: Review clinical appropriateness

2. **AI Automation Pilot**
   - Services: Pre-surgical imaging, routine labs
   - Model: NLP for clinical documentation
   - Safety: Human review for edge cases

3. **Auto-Approval Rules**
   ```python
   # Implement rules for:
   # - Gold card providers (all services)
   # - Services with >95% historical approval
   # - Repeat authorizations within 6 months
   ```

### Deliverables

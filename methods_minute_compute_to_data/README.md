# Compute-to-Data Implementation Toolkit

## Overview
This toolkit provides everything you need to pilot compute-to-data architectures in your healthcare organization. Stop moving data. Start moving intelligence.

## What's Included

### 1. Architecture Patterns (`/architecture/`)
- Reference architectures for common healthcare use cases
- Security considerations and compliance frameworks
- Technology selection matrices

### 2. Sample Functions (`/functions/`)
- Readmission risk scoring
- Quality measure calculations
- Population health queries
- Real-time alerting

### 3. Implementation Guides (`/guides/`)
- 4-week pilot roadmap
- Change management playbook
- ROI calculation templates
- Vendor evaluation criteria

### 4. Code Examples (`/examples/`)
- Python compute functions
- WebAssembly deployment patterns
- Secure enclave implementations
- API gateway configurations

## Quick Start

### Week 1: Pick Your Pilot
Choose one of these proven use cases:
- **Quality Measures**: Calculate HEDIS/CMS measures without data movement
- **Risk Scoring**: Deploy ML models directly to data sources
- **Real-time Alerts**: Process events at the source for immediate action

### Week 2: Deploy First Function
```python
# Example: Simple quality measure calculation
def calculate_diabetes_a1c_control(patient_ids):
    """
    Executes at the data source, returns only aggregated results
    """
    results = []
    for patient_id in patient_ids:
        # Query happens locally - data never leaves
        last_a1c = query_local_lab_results(patient_id, test='A1C')
        if last_a1c and last_a1c.value < 9.0:
            results.append({'patient_id': patient_id, 'controlled': True})
    
    # Only return summary statistics
    return {
        'total_patients': len(patient_ids),
        'controlled_count': len(results),
        'control_rate': len(results) / len(patient_ids)
    }
```

### Week 3: Measure Impact
Track these metrics:
- Time from request to deployment
- Data movement volume (should be near zero)
- Query performance vs. traditional approach
- Security audit results

### Week 4: Scale Decision
Use our ROI calculator to build your business case for expansion.

## Technology Options

### Compute Runtimes
1. **WebAssembly (WASM)** - Universal, sandboxed, language-agnostic
2. **Docker Containers** - Familiar, good tooling, requires orchestration
3. **Serverless Functions** - Cloud-native, auto-scaling, vendor lock-in risk
4. **Secure Enclaves** - Maximum security, hardware requirements

### Recommended Stack for Healthcare
- **Runtime**: WebAssembly for portability
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for container management
- **Security**: OAuth2 + mTLS for authentication
- **Monitoring**: OpenTelemetry for observability

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Federated Analytics
Deploy the same analysis function to multiple data sources, aggregate only results.

### Pattern 2: Event-Driven Processing
React to data changes in real-time without polling or batch transfers.

### Pattern 3: Privacy-Preserving ML
Train models using federated learning - model goes to data, not vice versa.

## Security Considerations
- All functions must be signed and verified
- Zero data egress policy enforcement
- Audit logging of all computations
- Result-only transmission protocols

## Getting Help
- Review the implementation guides for detailed steps
- Check examples for your specific use case
- Use the ROI calculator to build your business case

Remember: Start small, measure everything, scale horizontally.

# 4-Week Compute-to-Data Pilot Roadmap

## Executive Summary
Transform your data integration approach in 4 weeks. This roadmap guides you through a successful compute-to-data pilot that can significantly reduce integration time and costs.

---

## Week 1: Foundation & Use Case Selection

### Monday - Tuesday: Stakeholder Alignment
- [ ] Identify executive sponsor (CTO/CIO level)
- [ ] Form pilot team (1 architect, 1 developer, 1 data engineer)
- [ ] Schedule weekly stakeholder check-ins
- [ ] Define success metrics

### Wednesday - Thursday: Use Case Selection
**Evaluation Criteria:**
- High business value
- Currently takes > 4 weeks to integrate
- Single data source
- Clear ROI potential

**Recommended First Use Cases:**
1. **Quality Measure Calculation** (lowest risk)
   - Single source: EHR
   - Clear value: Automated reporting
   - Simple logic: SQL-based rules

2. **Readmission Risk Scoring** (medium complexity)
   - Single source: Clinical data
   - High value: Patient outcomes
   - Moderate logic: Risk algorithms

3. **Real-time Alerts** (highest impact)
   - Single source: Monitoring systems
   - Immediate value: Patient safety
   - Time-sensitive: Seconds matter

### Friday: Technical Assessment
- [ ] Inventory current data source capabilities
- [ ] Review security requirements
- [ ] Identify compute runtime options
- [ ] Document baseline metrics (current integration time/cost)

**Week 1 Deliverable:** Use case selection document with success criteria

## Week 2: Proof of Concept Development

### Monday: Environment Setup
```bash
# Example setup for WebAssembly runtime
git clone https://github.com/your-org/compute-to-data-starter
cd compute-to-data-starter
docker-compose up -d

# Verify local test environment
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

### Tuesday - Wednesday: Function Development
**Sample Structure:**
```python
# quality_measure.py
def calculate_diabetes_control(context):
    """Compute function that runs AT the data source"""
    
    # Query executes locally - no data movement
    patients = context.db.query("""
        SELECT patient_id, last_a1c_value, last_a1c_date
        FROM clinical_labs
        WHERE last_a1c_date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '12 months'
    """)
    
    # Process locally, return only aggregate
    controlled = sum(1 for p in patients if p.last_a1c_value < 9.0)
    
    return {
        "measure": "NQF-0059",
        "denominator": len(patients),
        "numerator": controlled,
        "rate": controlled / len(patients) if patients else 0,
        "computed_at": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
```

### Thursday: Security Integration
- [ ] Implement authentication (OAuth2/mTLS)
- [ ] Add audit logging
- [ ] Configure result-only transmission
- [ ] Test data isolation

### Friday: Local Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for compute function
- [ ] Integration test with mock data
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Security scan

**Week 2 Deliverable:** Working compute function with test results

---

## Week 3: Deployment & Measurement

### Monday - Tuesday: Production Deployment
**Deployment Checklist:**
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Security review passed
- [ ] Deployment credentials configured
- [ ] Monitoring enabled
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

**Deployment Script:**
```bash
# Deploy to production data source
./deploy.sh \
  --function quality_measure \
  --target prod-ehr \
  --version 1.0.0 \
  --canary 10%
```

### Wednesday: Initial Production Run
- [ ] Deploy to 10% traffic (canary)
- [ ] Monitor execution metrics
- [ ] Verify result accuracy
- [ ] Check performance impact

### Thursday: Full Rollout
- [ ] Expand to 100% if canary successful
- [ ] Document any issues
- [ ] Gather initial metrics

### Friday: Measurement & Analysis
**Key Metrics to Track:**
| Metric | Traditional | Compute-to-Data | Target Improvement |
|--------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Deployment Time | 6-8 weeks | Days | Significant reduction |
| Data Movement | Large volumes | Minimal | Near-zero movement |
| Query Latency | Batch processing | Real-time | Faster processing |
| Infrastructure Cost | High | Lower | Cost reduction |
| Security Risk | Data exposure | Data stays in place | Risk reduction |

**Week 3 Deliverable:** Production deployment with initial metrics

## Week 4: Optimization & Expansion Planning

### Monday - Tuesday: Performance Tuning
- [ ] Analyze execution logs
- [ ] Optimize slow queries
- [ ] Reduce memory footprint
- [ ] Implement caching where appropriate

### Wednesday: Documentation
Create these essential documents:
1. **Technical Architecture** - How it works
2. **Deployment Guide** - How to replicate
3. **Operations Runbook** - How to maintain
4. **Lessons Learned** - What we discovered

### Thursday: ROI Calculation
**ROI Template:**
```
Investment:
- Pilot development: [Hours] × [Rate]
- Infrastructure setup: [Cost]
- Total Investment: [Total]

Potential Annual Savings:
- Reduced integration time
- Lower infrastructure costs
- Reduced security risk
- Improved operational efficiency

Calculate your specific ROI based on actual metrics
```

### Friday: Expansion Roadmap
**Next Steps Planning:**
1. **Horizontal Expansion** (Month 2)
   - Deploy same function to other data sources
   - Expected time: 1 day per source

2. **Additional Use Cases** (Month 3)
   - Risk scoring algorithms
   - Population health queries
   - Real-time alerting

3. **Enterprise Rollout** (Months 4-6)
   - Establish compute-to-data platform team
   - Create self-service deployment tools
   - Build function marketplace

**Week 4 Deliverable:** Complete pilot report with expansion recommendations

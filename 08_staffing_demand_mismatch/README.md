# Staffing Variance Reduction Toolkit

## Quick Start Guide

This toolkit helps you reduce staffing variance and optimize labor costs through data-driven approaches.

### What's Included

#### 1. Analysis Tools (`/python/`)
- **staffing_variance_analyzer.py** - Analyze your current variance and identify patterns
- **demand_predictor.py** - ML model to forecast staffing needs 4 weeks ahead
- **roi_calculator.py** - Calculate your facility's specific ROI

#### 2. Database Queries (`/sql/`)
- **staffing_variance_analytics.sql** - Comprehensive SQL queries for metrics and patterns

#### 3. Dashboard Templates (`/dashboards/`)
- **staffing_variance_dashboard.md** - Real-time monitoring dashboard specifications

#### 4. Implementation Guides (`/guides/`)
- **18_month_implementation_roadmap.md** - Realistic transformation plan with proper change management
- **90_day_implementation_roadmap.md** - Accelerated pilot approach (aggressive timeline)
- **morning_huddle_protocol.md** - Daily rebalancing process (25-30 minutes)
- **flex_pool_implementation.md** - Create sustainable flex coverage with queueing theory

### Getting Started (First Hour)

1. **Run the Variance Analyzer**
   ```bash
   cd python
   python staffing_variance_analyzer.py
   ```
   This generates your baseline metrics and identifies patterns.

2. **Calculate Your ROI**
   ```bash
   python roi_calculator.py
   ```
   See your specific savings opportunity.

3. **Review Implementation Roadmap**
   Start with `/guides/90_day_implementation_roadmap.md`

### Installation

#### Python Requirements
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib
```

#### Data Requirements
- 6 months of staffing data (scheduled vs actual)
- Census data by unit and shift
- Overtime and agency hours

### Expected Outcomes

**30 Days:**
- Identify patterns (Monday surge, 3pm crisis)
- Launch pilot units
- Achieve <10% variance in pilot

**60 Days:**
- Predictive model operational
- Flex pool deployed
- 50% reduction in overtime

**90 Days:**
- Hospital-wide <8% variance
- 60% reduction in agency use
- $350K monthly savings

### Key Features

#### Predictive Staffing Model
- Machine learning-based forecasting
- Day-of-week pattern recognition
- Seasonal adjustment
- Continuous model improvement

#### Morning Huddle Protocol
- 15-minute rebalancing process
- Decision tree for staff moves
- Reduces same-day overtime by 30%

#### Flex Pool Calculator
- Right-sizes your flex pool
- ROI-optimized structure
- Implementation templates

### Support Files

#### Sample Data Format
The tools work with CSV files in this format:
```csv
date,unit,shift,census,scheduled_staff,actual_staff,overtime_hours,agency_hours
2024-01-01,Med-Surg-1,Day,24,6,7,4,0
```

#### Dashboard Integration
Compatible with:
- Tableau
- Power BI
- Excel
- Custom BI tools

### Common Use Cases

1. **Monday Surge Management**
   - Pre-schedule 40% extra coverage
   - Alert flex pool Sunday evening

2. **3pm Crisis Prevention**
   - Move huddle to 2pm
   - Pre-authorize overtime by 2:30pm

3. **Weekend Right-Sizing**
   - Reduce baseline by 15%
   - Deploy weekend flex pool

### ROI Summary

For a typical hospital:
- **Investment:** Technology, training, and process redesign
- **Savings:** Varies based on baseline variance and labor costs
- **Payback:** Typically 6-12 months
- **Long-term value:** Sustained operational savings

### Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Low prediction accuracy
**Solution:** Ensure 6+ months of historical data

**Issue:** Flex pool reluctance
**Solution:** Start with 15% differential, 4-hour minimum

**Issue:** Manager resistance
**Solution:** Show unit-specific variance costs

### Next Steps

1. Run variance analyzer on your data
2. Present findings to leadership
3. Select 2-3 pilot units
4. Follow 90-day roadmap

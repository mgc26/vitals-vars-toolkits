# Flex Pool Implementation Guide

## Executive Summary
Create a sustainable flex pool that reduces agency usage by 60% and provides predictable coverage for variance management.

---

## Flex Pool Structure Options

### Option 1: Internal Flex Pool (Recommended)
**Structure:**
- 0.5-0.7 FTE commitment per nurse
- Guaranteed 4-hour minimum shifts
- Home unit designation with float requirement
- Premium pay differential (10-15%)

**Pros:**
- Lower cost than agency
- Better culture fit
- Maintains competencies
- Predictable availability

**Cons:**
- Requires benefits
- Management overhead
- Training investment

### Option 2: Partner with Existing Float Pool
**Structure:**
- Designate float pool nurses as "flex-eligible"
- Additional compensation for flex shifts
- Priority scheduling for flex needs

**Pros:**
- Faster implementation
- Leverages existing structure
- No new hiring needed

**Cons:**
- May conflict with float pool priorities
- Limited availability
- Less control

### Option 3: External Partnership
**Structure:**
- Contract with staffing partner
- Dedicated nurse cohort
- Volume commitment

**Pros:**
- No employment overhead
- Scalable
- Risk transfer

**Cons:**
- Higher cost
- Less control over quality
- Cultural integration challenges

## Sizing Your Flex Pool

### Calculation Formula (Queueing Theory-Based):
```
Flex Pool Size = √(λσ²) × z₀.₉₅ + λμ

Where:
- λ = average daily demand (nurses needed)
- σ² = demand variance (from historical data)
- z₀.₉₅ = 1.645 (95th percentile of normal distribution)
- μ = expected shortage rate (typically 0.05-0.10)

Alternative M/M/c Model:
For more precise sizing, use M/M/c queueing model where:
- Arrival rate (λ): patient admissions per hour
- Service rate (μ): patients per nurse per shift
- Target: P(wait > 30 min) ≤ 5%
```

### Example for 300-bed Hospital:
- Average daily shortage: 3-4 nurses
- Coverage needed: 7 days/week
- Target utilization: 75%

**Calculation:** (3.5 × 7) / 0.75 = 32.7 flex shifts/week
**With 0.6 FTE commitment:** 32.7 / (0.6 × 3) = 18 flex pool nurses needed

# Morning Huddle Protocol for Staffing Rebalancing

## Overview
A 25-30 minute daily huddle that reduces same-day overtime through proactive staff rebalancing using decision support tools.

---

## Huddle Schedule
**Time:** 6:45 AM (Day Shift) | 2:45 PM (Evening) | 10:45 PM (Night)
**Duration:** 25-30 minutes (with decision support system)
**Location:** Central nursing station or virtual
**Participants:** Unit managers, staffing coordinator, house supervisor

---

## Pre-Huddle Preparation (5 minutes before)

### Staffing Coordinator Tasks:
1. Pull current census for all units
2. Review scheduled vs actual staff
3. Check sick calls received
4. Identify units with variance >20%
5. Review flex pool availability

### Unit Manager Tasks:
1. Confirm unit census
2. Identify anticipated discharges/admissions
3. Note any special needs (1:1 sitters, procedures)
4. Flag any staff concerns

---

## Huddle Agenda (25-30 minutes)

### 1. Data Collection & Status Check (5 minutes)
**Staffing Coordinator leads:**
```
"Good morning. Current hospital census is [X]. 
We have [Y] sick calls and [Z] open shifts.
Red units: [List units with variance >20%]
Green units: [List units with surplus staff]"
```

### 2. Unit Roll Call (8 minutes)
**Each unit manager (45 seconds max):**
```
"[Unit name]: Census [X], Staff [Y], Need [Z]
Anticipated: [admissions/discharges]
Can give: [number] | Need: [number]"
```

### 3. Optimization & Rebalancing Decisions (10 minutes)
**House Supervisor with decision support system:**

**Decision Tree:**
```
IF unit needs staff:
  1. Check adjacent units for surplus
  2. Check same-specialty units
  3. Check flex pool availability
  4. Consider 4-hour partial shifts
  5. Last resort: Approve overtime

IF unit has surplus:
  1. Offer to deficit units
  2. Offer early release (volunteers first)
  3. Assign to non-direct care tasks
  4. Bank for later shift if anticipated need
```

### 4. Action Confirmation & Communication (5-7 minutes)
**Staffing Coordinator summarizes:**
```
"Moves confirmed:
- [Name] from [Unit A] to [Unit B]
- Flex pool: [Names] to [Units]
- Overtime approved: [Units and hours]
- Early release: [Names] from [Units]"
```

---

## Rebalancing Rules

### Eligible for Rebalancing:
- Nurses with appropriate competencies
- Staff not in orientation
- No more than one move per shift
- Maintain core staff on each unit

### Priority for Receiving Staff:
1. Units with variance >25%
2. ICU/ED with high acuity
3. Units with anticipated admissions
4. Units with multiple new grads

### Priority for Giving Staff:
1. Units with variance <-10% (overstaffed)
2. Units with all experienced staff
3. Units with predicted low census
4. Units with scheduled discharges

---

## Communication Scripts

### Notifying Staff of Rebalancing:
```
"Hi [Name], based on current census, we need to rebalance staffing. 
Would you be willing to help [Unit] today? They're short-staffed 
and your skills would really help. You'll return to your home unit tomorrow."
```

### If Staff Resists:
```
"I understand this isn't ideal. We rotate rebalancing fairly - 
you haven't been moved in [X] weeks. The patient safety need is critical. 
Can I address any specific concerns?"
```

### Thanking Flexible Staff:
```
"Thank you for being flexible today. Your willingness to help 
makes a huge difference for patient care and your colleagues. 
I'll note this in your file for recognition."
```

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Action | Who Decides |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 nurse short, adjacent unit has surplus | Move nurse | Unit managers agree |
| 2+ nurses short, no surplus available | Call flex pool | Staffing coordinator |
| Critical shortage (>25% variance) | Approve overtime | House supervisor |
| Multiple units short | Prioritize by acuity | House supervisor |
| Unexpected admission surge | Call backup flex | Staffing coordinator |
| Staff calls in sick during shift | Immediate rebalance | Charge nurses |

---

## Technology Support

### Dashboard View Needed:
- Real-time census by unit
- Current staffing levels
- Variance percentage (color-coded)
- Flex pool availability
- Predicted admissions

### Communication Tools:
- Group text for quick decisions
- Staffing app for moves
- Email confirmation of changes
- Whiteboard for visual tracking

---

## Success Metrics

### Track Daily:
- Huddle duration (target: <15 min)
- Number of successful rebalances
- Overtime hours avoided
- Units achieving <10% variance

### Track Weekly:
- Staff satisfaction with process
- Manager participation rate
- Flex pool utilization
- Cost savings from avoided overtime

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Huddle Creep:** Stick to 15 minutes
2. **Favoritism:** Rotate rebalancing fairly
3. **Last-Minute Only:** Plan for known patterns
4. **Ignoring Competencies:** Verify skills match
5. **Poor Communication:** Always confirm moves
6. **No Follow-Up:** Check on moved staff mid-shift

---

## Escalation Protocol

### When to Escalate Beyond Huddle:
- Variance >30% on multiple units
- No flex pool available
- Multiple sick calls during shift
- Unexpected surge (mass casualty, etc.)
- Union grievances about moves

### Escalation Path:
1. House Supervisor
2. Administrative Coordinator on-call
3. Chief Nursing Officer
4. Hospital Administrator on-call

---

## Sample Huddle Outcome

**Starting Position:**
- ICU: -2 nurses (25% variance)
- Med-Surg-1: +1 nurse (overstaffed)
- Med-Surg-2: -1 nurse
- ED: Adequate
- Flex Pool: 2 available

**Rebalancing Actions:**
1. Move 1 nurse from Med-Surg-1 to Med-Surg-2
2. Deploy 2 flex pool nurses to ICU
3. No overtime needed

**Result:**
- All units <10% variance
- $1,350 overtime avoided
- Staff satisfaction maintained

---

## Monthly Optimization

### Review Monthly:
- Average huddle duration
- Most frequent deficit units
- Rebalancing success rate
- Staff feedback themes

### Adjust Based on Patterns:
- Modify huddle time if needed
- Update flex pool schedule
- Revise decision tree
- Retrain as needed

# AI Framework Industrial Complex Toolkit

## Overview

This toolkit helps health systems navigate the fragmented landscape of 36+ AI governance frameworks with practical tools for prioritization, implementation, and risk mitigation.

## What's Included

### 1. Framework Comparison Matrix
Side-by-side comparison of major frameworks showing:
- Enforcement mechanisms
- Implementation requirements
- Areas of redundancy
- Practical utility assessment

**Use when:** Evaluating which frameworks actually require attention vs. which are background noise.

### 2. Framework Decision Tree
Interactive decision guide answering: "Which framework(s) do I actually need to comply with?"

Factors considered:
- Regulatory jurisdiction (FDA, ONC, CMS)
- Organization type (hospital, health system, vendor)
- AI application category (medical device, certified health IT, third-party tool)
- International scope

**Use when:** Starting governance program or onboarding new AI tool.

### 3. Practical Simplification Guide
The five-category operational model replacing 36 framework checklists:
1. Safety and Risk
2. Evidence and Validation
3. Monitoring and Maintenance
4. Human Factors
5. Accountability

Each category includes:
- Operational requirements
- Measurable outcomes
- Implementation resources needed
- Red flags indicating gaps

**Use when:** Designing internal governance processes that prevent harm rather than checking boxes.

### 4. Governance Theatre Red Flags Checklist
Warning signs your organization is investing in compliance appearance without substance:
- Committee structures without monitoring infrastructure
- Vendor attestations without validation data
- Pre-deployment reviews without post-deployment tracking
- Documentation requirements without outcome metrics

**Use when:** Auditing existing governance programs or evaluating vendor proposals.

## How to Use This Toolkit

### If You're Starting from Scratch
1. **Start with Framework Decision Tree** to identify mandatory vs. voluntary frameworks
2. **Review Framework Comparison Matrix** to understand overlaps
3. **Adopt Practical Simplification Guide** as internal governance structure
4. **Use Red Flags Checklist** quarterly to audit governance effectiveness

### If You Have Existing Governance
1. **Run Red Flags Checklist** to identify theatre vs. substance
2. **Map existing processes to Practical Simplification Guide** categories
3. **Use Framework Comparison Matrix** to eliminate redundant compliance efforts
4. **Focus resources on gaps** (likely post-deployment monitoring and incident reporting)

### If You're Evaluating AI Vendors
1. **Use Framework Comparison Matrix** to assess vendor framework claims
2. **Apply Red Flags Checklist** to vendor governance statements
3. **Demand evidence** for Practical Simplification Guide categories (especially validation and monitoring)
4. **Review liability terms** against accountability requirements

## Key Principles

**Prioritize enforcement over aspiration.** FDA and ONC requirements matter because they have teeth. Voluntary frameworks matter only if they provide implementation tools.

**Measure outcomes, not documents.** Governance effectiveness shows up in incident rates, performance maintenance, and bias detection—not in policy page counts.

**Invest in infrastructure, not committees.** Real governance requires automated monitoring pipelines, not quarterly meetings.

**Distinguish compliance from safety.** Meeting framework requirements doesn't guarantee you won't cause harm. Focus on what prevents adverse outcomes.

## What This Toolkit Won't Do

This toolkit won't help you:
- Achieve "certification" in voluntary frameworks (that's not the goal)
- Generate boilerplate policies for compliance appearance
- Create elaborate committee structures without operational teeth
- Claim adherence to all 36 frameworks simultaneously

This toolkit helps you separate signal from noise and build governance that protects patients rather than paperwork that protects institutions.

## Getting Started

Most health systems should:
1. **Spend 20% of governance time** on mandatory compliance (FDA, ONC if applicable)
2. **Spend 10% of governance time** on one operational best-practice framework (recommend ACR's ARCH-AI/Assess-AI model as template)
3. **Spend 70% of governance time** building infrastructure: drift detection, performance monitoring, incident reporting, validation processes

If your current allocation is reversed—70% on framework mapping, 10% on operational work—you're doing governance theatre.

## Additional Resources

- **ACR ARCH-AI Guidelines**: Most actionable specialty-specific framework
- **AMA STEPS Forward Toolkit**: Practical governance implementation guide
- **FDA PCCP Guidance**: Understanding regulatory requirements for adaptive algorithms
- **ONC HTI-1 Rule**: Transparency requirements for certified health IT

## Questions This Toolkit Answers

- Which frameworks have actual enforcement mechanisms?
- Where do frameworks conflict or create redundant requirements?
- What operational capabilities prevent AI harm?
- How do I distinguish governance theatre from governance substance?
- What should I fund: committees or infrastructure?
- When is a vendor transferring liability risk under the guise of "shared responsibility"?

## Questions This Toolkit Doesn't Answer

This toolkit focuses on governance pragmatics, not:
- Detailed technical implementation of monitoring systems
- Specific bias detection algorithms
- Legal liability allocation (consult legal counsel)
- Reimbursement strategy for AI services

For technical implementation details, see healthcare AI engineering resources. For legal questions, engage counsel familiar with medical device and health IT law.

**Bottom Line:** You don't need to comply with 36 frameworks. You need to answer five operational questions with measurable outcomes. This toolkit shows you how.

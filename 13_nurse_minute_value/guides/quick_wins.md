Low-cost, high-impact interventions you can implement in 0-90 days to reclaim nurse time.

---

## 0-30 Days: Immediate Actions

### 🎯 EHR Documentation Cleanup

**What:** Audit and remove redundant or low-value documentation fields.

**Evidence:** Kansas University Health System removed 748 elements through their "Mission POSSIBLE" initiative, returned 30,000 hours/year ($1.42M value) [14].

**Action steps:**
- [ ] Form a nurse-led documentation review team
- [ ] Identify "most hated" documentation fields (nurse survey)
- [ ] Review fields for regulatory/billing necessity
- [ ] Deactivate or hide non-required fields
- [ ] Test with pilot unit before system-wide rollout

**Expected time savings:** 5-15 minutes/shift
**Implementation cost:** <$5,000 (mostly staff time)
**Payback:** <30 days

---

### 🎯 Supply Access Optimization

**What:** Move frequently used supplies to bedside or create mobile carts.

**Problem:** Nurses spend significant time walking to supply rooms, searching for items.

**Action steps:**
- [ ] Track most frequently retrieved supplies (observation or survey)
- [ ] Place top 20 items in bedside drawers or rolling carts
- [ ] Implement "par levels" and daily restocking process
- [ ] Consider automated dispensing for high-value/controlled items

**Expected time savings:** 10-15 minutes/shift
**Implementation cost:** $5,000-$15,000 (carts + supplies)
**Payback:** 2-4 months

---

### 🎯 Reduce Low-Value Alerts

**What:** Turn off or adjust sensitivity of non-actionable EHR alerts.

**Problem:** Alert fatigue leads to missed critical alerts and wasted time dismissing irrelevant ones.

**Action steps:**
- [ ] Run EHR alert report (frequency, override rate by type)
- [ ] Identify alerts with >90% override rate
- [ ] Turn off or adjust thresholds for low-value alerts
- [ ] Monitor for unintended consequences

**Expected time savings:** 2-5 minutes/shift
**Implementation cost:** $0 (configuration change)
**Payback:** Immediate

---

### 🎯 Standardize Handoff Process

**What:** Implement structured handoff tool (e.g., SBAR, I-PASS).

**Evidence:** Reduces handoff time and improves quality of information transfer.

**Action steps:**
- [ ] Select standardized handoff framework
- [ ] Create EHR-integrated handoff template
- [ ] Train all nurses on new process
- [ ] Protect time for uninterrupted handoffs

**Expected time savings:** 5-10 minutes/shift
**Implementation cost:** $2,000-$5,000 (training materials)
**Payback:** <60 days

---

## 30-60 Days: Low-Complexity Projects

### 🎯 Hire Unit Clerks / Support Staff

**What:** Delegate non-clinical tasks to lower-cost support staff.

**Evidence:** Columbine West Health hired clerks at $17/hr vs. RN $38.50/hr, reduced overtime 32.5%, reduced turnover 42.5% [15].

**Tasks to delegate:**
- Answering phones
- Bed management coordination
- Supply restocking
- Scheduling
- Patient transport coordination

**Action steps:**
- [ ] Calculate current RN time on delegable tasks (time study)
- [ ] Define clerk role and responsibilities
- [ ] Hire and train unit clerks
- [ ] Measure impact on RN time allocation

**Expected time savings:** 15-30 minutes/shift per RN
**Implementation cost:** $35,000-$50,000/year per clerk (ongoing)
**ROI:** Positive if wage differential + turnover savings exceed cost

---

### 🎯 Smart Pump Integration

**What:** Auto-populate pump data into EHR instead of manual entry.

**Action steps:**
- [ ] Enable bidirectional pump-EHR integration
- [ ] Train nurses on new workflow
- [ ] Validate data accuracy

**Expected time savings:** 3-5 minutes/shift
**Implementation cost:** $10,000-$50,000 (if pumps already support it)
**Payback:** 6-12 months

---

### 🎯 Batching & Dedicated Zones

**What:** Create protected time/space for focused work.

**Examples:**
- "No interruption" med pass time (6-8am, 6-8pm)
- Dedicated documentation zone (quiet, ergonomic)
- Scheduled rounding times vs. ad-hoc

**Action steps:**
- [ ] Identify high-interruption tasks
- [ ] Pilot protected time on one unit
- [ ] Train staff to respect boundaries
- [ ] Measure impact on task completion and errors

**Expected time savings:** Indirect (fewer errors, less rework)
**Implementation cost:** $0 (policy change)

---

## 60-90 Days: Medium-Complexity Projects

### 🎯 EHR Workflow Optimization (Duke Health Model)

**What:** Re-engineer EHR flowsheets to match actual clinical workflow.

**Evidence:** Duke Health removed 433 data points, saved 1.5-6.5 min/reassessment, 18.5% documentation reduction [8].

**Action steps:**
- [ ] Map current documentation workflow (time-motion study)
- [ ] Identify redundant fields, poor sequencing, unnecessary clicks
- [ ] Redesign flowsheets with nurse input
- [ ] Build and test in sandbox environment
- [ ] Pilot on 1-2 units
- [ ] Measure pre/post documentation time
- [ ] Roll out system-wide

**Expected time savings:** 10-20 minutes/shift
**Implementation cost:** $5,000-$20,000 (informatics staff time)
**Payback:** 1-3 months

---

### 🎯 Voice-to-Text Documentation

**What:** Enable speech recognition for narrative notes.

**Action steps:**
- [ ] Pilot voice-to-text tool (Dragon, native EHR feature, or AI scribe)
- [ ] Train nurses on effective dictation
- [ ] Measure adoption and time savings
- [ ] Evaluate accuracy and need for editing

**Expected time savings:** 5-10 minutes/shift (for narrative notes)
**Implementation cost:** $50-$200/user/year (software)
**Payback:** 6-18 months

---

### 🎯 Automated Vital Signs Integration

**What:** Auto-import vitals from bedside monitors/devices into EHR.

**Action steps:**
- [ ] Enable device-EHR integration (if available)
- [ ] Validate data accuracy
- [ ] Train nurses to verify, not re-enter
- [ ] Monitor for missing data or errors

**Expected time savings:** 2-5 minutes/shift
**Implementation cost:** $10,000-$100,000 (device/interface costs)
**Payback:** 12-24 months

---

### 🎯 Mobile Workstations on Wheels (WOWs)

**What:** Provide mobile computers for bedside documentation.

**Benefit:** Reduces walking time, enables real-time charting.

**Action steps:**
- [ ] Pilot WOWs on high-traffic units
- [ ] Ensure battery life, WiFi coverage
- [ ] Train on infection control (cleaning between rooms)
- [ ] Measure time at bedside vs. nurse station

**Expected time savings:** 10-15 minutes/shift (reduced walking)
**Implementation cost:** $2,000-$5,000 per WOW
**Payback:** 12-18 months

## Measurement Checklist

For each intervention, measure:
- [ ] **Baseline:** Pre-intervention time allocation (time study or EHR data)
- [ ] **Pilot results:** Time saved during pilot phase
- [ ] **Adoption rate:** % of nurses using new tool/workflow
- [ ] **Nurse satisfaction:** Survey scores on workflow improvement
- [ ] **Patient outcomes:** Any changes in quality metrics
- [ ] **ROI:** Actual vs. projected financial return

## Prioritization Matrix

Use this framework to prioritize interventions:

| Intervention | Time Saved | Implementation Cost | Complexity | Priority Score |
|--------------|------------|---------------------|------------|----------------|
| Remove redundant alerts | Medium | $0 | Low | **HIGH** |
| Bedside supply carts | Medium | $10K | Low | **HIGH** |
| Documentation cleanup | High | $5K | Medium | **HIGH** |
| EHR flowsheet redesign | High | $15K | High | **MEDIUM** |
| Smart pump integration | Low | $50K | High | **LOW** |

**Priority Score = (Time Saved × 3) - (Cost/1000) - (Complexity × 2)**

---

## Quick Wins Success Criteria

**You know you've succeeded when:**
- [ ] Nurses report less frustration with workflows
- [ ] Documentation time decreases by 10-20%
- [ ] Bedside time increases by 10-15%
- [ ] Turnover rate stabilizes or decreases
- [ ] HCAHPS "nurse communication" scores improve
- [ ] ROI exceeds 200% within first year

---

## Avoid These Mistakes

1. **Implementing without nurse input:** Nurses know the pain points best. Co-design solutions.
2. **No baseline measurement:** Can't prove ROI without pre-intervention data.
3. **Skipping the pilot:** Test on one unit before system-wide rollout.
4. **Set-it-and-forget-it:** Monitor adoption and optimize continuously.
5. **Ignoring unintended consequences:** Watch for workarounds or new inefficiencies.

## Next Steps

1. Pick 2-3 quick wins from the 0-30 day list
2. Conduct baseline time study (or use existing data)
3. Form nurse-led improvement team
4. Pilot, measure, and iterate
5. Calculate and report ROI
6. Scale successful interventions

**Remember:** Small changes compound. Even saving 10 minutes/shift × 500 nurses = 83,000 hours/year = $7.5 million in value.

# Nurse Time Valuation Toolkit

Ready-to-use tools to measure, value, and optimize how your nursing time is allocated.

## Quick Start

1. **Calculate Your Baseline** → Use the Time Value Calculator
2. **Conduct Time Study** → Follow the time study template
3. **Analyze Results** → Run the Python analysis script
4. **Visualize Impact** → Build the dashboard
5. **Implement Changes** → Follow the optimization guide

## What's Included

### 📊 SQL Queries (`sql/`)
- Nurse productivity and time allocation queries
- Task time tracking (if captured in your EHR)
- Patient outcome correlation analysis
- Supply utilization tracking

### 🐍 Python Analysis (`python/`)
- Nurse time valuation calculator
- ROI model for time-saving interventions
- Turnover cost calculator
- Time allocation analysis and visualization

### 📈 Dashboard Templates (`dashboards/`)
- Power BI: Nurse time allocation dashboard
- Tableau: Task value analysis template
- Real-time productivity monitoring

### 📋 Implementation Guides (`guides/`)
- How to conduct a nursing time study
- Task prioritization framework
- Quick wins checklist
- 12-week optimization roadmap

## Key Metrics

This toolkit helps you measure:
- **Cost per minute** of RN time (loaded labor rate)
- **Time allocation** by task type (clinical vs. administrative)
- **ROI** of workflow interventions
- **Outcome correlation** between bedside time and patient results

## Expected Results

Organizations using these tools typically:
- Identify 30-60 minutes per shift of recoverable nurse time
- Achieve ROI within 6-12 months on targeted interventions
- Reduce nurse turnover through improved workflows
- Improve patient outcomes through increased bedside time

## Getting Started

```bash
# Calculate your baseline time value
cd python
pip install -r requirements.txt
python nurse_time_calculator.py

# Run time allocation analysis
python time_allocation_analysis.py

# Check SQL queries
cd ../sql
# Review nurse_time_queries.sql
```

## Use Cases

- **Finance Teams**: Calculate true cost of nursing workflows
- **Nurse Managers**: Identify time allocation optimization opportunities
- **Quality Teams**: Correlate nurse time with patient outcomes
- **Operations**: Model ROI of workflow improvement initiatives

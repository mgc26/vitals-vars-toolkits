- [ ] **Budget Commitment**: 18+ month funding secured
- [ ] **Risk Tolerance**: Acceptance of iterative development

### Governance Structure
- [ ] **Steering Committee**: Cross-functional oversight team
- [ ] **Clinical Governance**: Validation and safety protocols
- [ ] **Change Management**: Process for clinical adoption
- [ ] **Compliance Framework**: HIPAA, security, and regulatory processes

### Operational Maturity
- [ ] **Previous ML Success**: At least one production ML model
- [ ] **Maintenance Capability**: 24/7 support structure
- [ ] **Training Programs**: Ability to train end users
- [ ] **Performance Metrics**: KPIs and measurement framework

## Project-Specific Factors

### Use Case Characteristics
- [ ] **Unique Requirements**: Not solved by existing vendors
- [ ] **Competitive Advantage**: Core to organizational strategy
- [ ] **Scalability Needs**: >10,000 daily predictions
- [ ] **Custom Workflows**: Highly specific clinical protocols

### Timeline Considerations
- [ ] **Realistic Timeline**: 12-18 months acceptable
- [ ] **Phased Approach**: Can deliver incremental value
- [ ] **No Regulatory Rush**: Not blocking compliance
- [ ] **Market Timing**: First-mover advantage exists

### Risk Assessment
- [ ] **Technical Risk**: Well-understood problem space
- [ ] **Clinical Risk**: Clear safety protocols
- [ ] **Financial Risk**: ROI model validated
- [ ] **Reputation Risk**: Failure impact assessed

## Scoring Guide

### Scoring System
- **0-5 boxes checked**: Strong Buy Signal
- **6-10 boxes checked**: Lean Buy, consider hybrid
- **11-15 boxes checked**: Evaluate both options carefully
- **16-20 boxes checked**: Lean Build, if use case warrants
- **21+ boxes checked**: Strong Build Signal

### Critical Must-Haves for Building
These items are non-negotiable for a build decision:
1. [ ] Executive sponsorship
2. [ ] 18+ month funding
3. [ ] Minimum 3 technical FTEs
4. [ ] Clinical governance structure
5. [ ] Unique use case or data

If ANY of these are missing, strongly consider buying.

## Red Flags Against Building

### Technical Red Flags
- No existing data infrastructure
- Less than 1 year of clean data
- No ML/AI experience in-house
- No established DevOps practices

### Organizational Red Flags
- History of failed IT projects
- Frequent leadership changes
- Competing strategic priorities
- Limited change management capability

### Project Red Flags
- Commodity problem (many vendors solve it)
- Urgent timeline (<6 months)
- Regulatory requirements (FDA clearance needed)
- Single stakeholder dependency

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Assessment**: Check all applicable boxes
2. **Calculate Score**: Use scoring guide above
3. **Review Red Flags**: Any present? Reconsider build
4. **Gap Analysis**: What's needed to be build-ready?
5. **Decision Meeting**: Present findings to stakeholders

## Hybrid Approach Considerations

Even if not fully build-ready, consider:
- **Buy Platform, Build Models**: Use vendor MLOps, custom algorithms
- **Phased Approach**: Buy now, build later when ready
- **Partnership Model**: Co-develop with vendor
- **Center of Excellence**: Build capability over time

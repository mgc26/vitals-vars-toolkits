# Buy vs. Build Decision Toolkit for Healthcare AI/Analytics

## Quick Start Guide

This toolkit helps healthcare organizations make data-driven decisions about whether to buy vendor solutions or build custom AI/analytics capabilities.

## What's Included

### 1. Decision Matrix (`templates/decision_matrix.xlsx`)
- 5-factor weighted scoring model
- Customizable weights based on organizational priorities
- Auto-calculates buy vs. build recommendation

### 2. TCO Calculator (`templates/tco_calculator.xlsx`)
- 5-year total cost of ownership comparison
- Includes hidden costs often overlooked
- NPV and ROI calculations

### 3. Vendor Evaluation Scorecard (`templates/vendor_scorecard.xlsx`)
- 50+ evaluation criteria
- Covers technical, operational, and financial factors
- Weighted scoring with comparison charts

### 4. Build Readiness Assessment (`guides/build_readiness_checklist.md`)
- Technical capability assessment
- Organizational readiness factors
- Risk evaluation framework

### 5. Python Analysis Tools (`python/`)
- `decision_analyzer.py`: Automated decision analysis
- `tco_comparison.py`: Detailed cost modeling
- `vendor_comparison.py`: Multi-vendor analysis

### 6. Implementation Roadmaps (`templates/`)
- `build_roadmap_template.mpp`: Microsoft Project template for build projects
- `buy_implementation_template.mpp`: Vendor implementation timeline

## How to Use This Toolkit

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
1. Complete the Build Readiness Checklist
2. Document your requirements in the Decision Matrix

### Step 2: Analysis
1. If considering vendors, use the Vendor Evaluation Scorecard
2. Complete TCO calculations for both options
3. Run the Python decision analyzer for additional insights

### Step 3: Decision
1. Review the weighted scores from the Decision Matrix
2. Consider the 5-year TCO comparison
3. Document your decision rationale

### Step 4: Implementation
1. Use the appropriate roadmap template
2. Customize based on your specific context
3. Track against the success metrics defined

## Key Decision Factors

### Strong Buy Signals
- Commodity problem (solved by many)
- Need results in <6 months
- Limited technical resources
- Regulatory requirements (FDA cleared)

### Strong Build Signals
- Unique competitive advantage
- Proprietary data or algorithms
- Complex integration requirements
- Long-term strategic investment

### Consider Hybrid Approach
- Buy the platform/infrastructure
- Build the differentiating features
- Partner for specialized capabilities

## Sample Use Cases

### Example 1: Sepsis Prediction
- **Scenario**: Academic medical center with unique patient population
- **Decision**: Build
- **Rationale**: Proprietary clinical protocols, research focus
- **Result**: 23% mortality reduction

### Example 2: OR Scheduling
- **Scenario**: Regional health system
- **Decision**: Buy
- **Rationale**: Commodity problem, quick deployment needed
- **Result**: 15% utilization improvement in 4 months

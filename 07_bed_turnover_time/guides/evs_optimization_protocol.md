# EVS Optimization Protocol for 90-Minute Bed Turnover

## Executive Summary
This protocol outlines evidence-based practices to achieve consistent 90-minute bed turnover times through optimized Environmental Services (EVS) operations.

## Core Principles

### 1. Parallel Processing
Move from sequential to parallel workflows wherever safe and feasible.

### 2. Proactive Positioning
Position staff and supplies based on predicted discharge patterns.

### 3. Clear Communication
Establish unambiguous communication channels and response expectations.

### 4. Continuous Monitoring
Track performance in real-time and adjust dynamically.

## Phase 1: Immediate Notification (Target: 0-5 minutes)

### Discharge Alert System
**Automated Triggers**
- EMR discharge order = Immediate EVS notification
- Pre-discharge alert at physician rounding
- 30-minute warning when discharge pending

**Manual Backup**
- Charge nurse red flag system
- Direct EVS hotline (dedicated number)
- Mobile app notification

### Response Protocol
1. EVS dispatcher acknowledges within 2 minutes
2. Assigns staff based on:
   - Unit location
   - Current workload
   - Isolation requirements
   - Room complexity
3. Confirms ETA to unit

## Phase 2: Rapid Response (Target: 5-15 minutes)

### Pre-Positioning Strategy
**Peak Discharge Hours (11 AM - 3 PM)**
- Station 1 EVS staff per 20 beds on each unit
- Pre-stock cleaning carts at unit level
- Designate "float" staff for surge capacity

**Equipment Readiness**
- Cleaning carts fully stocked at shift start
- Backup supplies on each unit
- Specialized equipment (UV lights, etc.) centrally located

### Travel Time Reduction
- Unit-based staff during peak hours
- Express elevators designated for EVS (where feasible)
- Optimized cleaning routes by geography

## Phase 3: Efficient Cleaning (Target: 45 minutes)

### Standard Room Protocol (Non-Isolation)
**Two-Person Team Approach**
- Person A: High-touch surfaces, bathroom
- Person B: Floor, bed, furniture
- Concurrent work cuts time by 40%

**Cleaning Sequence**
1. **Initial Entry (2 min)**
   - Safety check
   - Ventilation started
   - Major debris removed

2. **High-Touch Disinfection (15 min)**
   - Bed rails, controls
   - Call buttons, phones
   - Door handles, light switches
   - TV remote, tables

3. **Bathroom Deep Clean (10 min)**
   - All surfaces disinfected
   - Floor mopped
   - Supplies restocked

4. **Floor and Furniture (15 min)**
   - Dust mopping
   - Wet mopping
   - Furniture positioning
   - Window cleaning (as needed)

5. **Final Inspection (3 min)**
   - Checklist verification
   - Quality spot-check
   - Status update in system

### Isolation Room Protocol
**Additional Requirements**
- Single person entry (safety)
- Extended contact times
- Terminal clean procedures
- Target: 60-75 minutes

**PPE Management**
- Pre-staged outside room
- Proper donning/doffing area
- Immediate disposal system

### Innovation Opportunities
**Technology Integration**
- UV-C disinfection (reduces time by 15 min)
- Electrostatic sprayers for large areas
- ATP testing for immediate verification

## Phase 4: Quality Assurance (Target: 5 minutes)

### Real-Time Verification
**Digital Checklist**
- Mobile device completion
- Photo documentation option
- Automatic timestamp
- Immediate bed status update

### Spot Check Protocol
- Supervisor random audits (10% of rooms)
- Nursing verification before occupied
- Monthly deep audits by Infection Prevention

### Feedback Loop
- Immediate re-clean if failed
- Root cause analysis for failures
- Recognition for consistent quality

## Phase 5: Status Communication (Target: 0-2 minutes)

### Automated Updates
**System Integration**
- EVS complete = Automatic bed board update
- Text notification to charge nurse
- Alert to bed placement
- Update patient flow dashboard

### Manual Confirmation
- Green light/flag system on door
- Verbal confirmation to nurse
- Sign-off in tracking system

## Staffing Optimization

### Demand-Based Scheduling
**Data-Driven Approach**
- Analyze 90-day discharge patterns
- Identify peak hours by unit
- Adjust shifts to match demand

**Recommended Staffing Model**
- 7 AM - 3 PM: 130% of baseline
- 3 PM - 11 PM: 80% of baseline  
- 11 PM - 7 AM: 50% of baseline
- On-call pool for surges

### Cross-Training Initiative
**Multi-Skilled Workers**
- EVS + Transport capabilities
- Unit-specific competencies
- Flexibility for redeployment

### Performance Incentives
- Turnover time bonuses
- Quality score recognition
- Career advancement pathway

## Communication Workflows

### Daily Huddles
**7 AM Huddle (10 minutes)**
- Previous day performance
- Today's predicted volume
- Staffing adjustments
- Special circumstances

**11 AM Check-in (5 minutes)**
- Real-time status
- Bottleneck identification
- Resource reallocation

### Escalation Protocol
**Level 1: Unit Delay (>30 min)**
- Charge nurse to EVS supervisor
- Additional resources deployed

**Level 2: Multiple Delays (>60 min)**
- EVS manager notification
- All-hands deployment
- Executive awareness

**Level 3: System Failure (>90 min)**
- Incident command activation
- C-suite notification
- Recovery plan initiated

## Technology Enablers

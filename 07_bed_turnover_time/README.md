# Bed Turnover Optimization Toolkit

## Overview
This toolkit provides comprehensive resources to help hospitals reduce bed turnover time from the industry average of 2-4 hours to the best practice target of 90 minutes. Based on evidence-based practices and real-world implementations, these tools can help recover millions in lost revenue while improving patient flow.

## What's Included

### üìä SQL Analytics (`/sql`)
- **bed_turnover_analytics.sql**: Comprehensive queries to analyze your current bed turnover performance, including:
  - Time segment analysis (discharge ‚Üí EVS ‚Üí clean ‚Üí occupied)
  - Bottleneck identification by unit and shift
  - Financial impact calculations
  - Predictive discharge planning queries
  - EVS staffing optimization analysis

### üêç Python Analysis Tools (`/python`)
- **bed_turnover_analyzer.py**: Complete analysis framework for bed turnover metrics
  - Generate sample data for testing
  - Calculate bottleneck severity by phase
  - Visualize turnover patterns and trends
  - Export executive-ready reports
  
- **roi_calculator.py**: Financial modeling tool for improvement initiatives
  - Calculate current revenue loss
  - Project ROI for interventions
  - Sensitivity analysis
  - 5-year NPV calculations

### üìà Dashboard Templates (`/dashboards`)
- **real_time_bed_status_dashboard.md**: Specifications for building real-time visibility
  - Tableau implementation guide
  - Power BI DAX measures
  - Alert configuration
  - Mobile optimization tips

### üìã Implementation Guides (`/guides`)
- **90_day_implementation_roadmap.md**: Week-by-week transformation plan
  - Pre-launch preparation
  - Phase-based rollout
  - Change management strategies
  - Sustainability planning

- **evs_optimization_protocol.md**: Detailed EVS workflow optimization
  - Parallel processing techniques
  - Staffing models
  - Communication protocols
  - Quality assurance methods

## Quick Start

### 1. Assess Your Current State
```sql
-- Run the baseline analysis query from bed_turnover_analytics.sql
-- This will show your current average turnover times by unit
```

### 2. Calculate Your Opportunity
```python
# Use the ROI calculator to size your improvement potential
python roi_calculator.py

# Example output:
# Annual Revenue Loss: $4,300,000
# Payback Period: 4.2 months
# 5-Year NPV: $18,500,000
```

### 3. Build Visibility
Deploy the real-time dashboard to make bed status visible to all stakeholders. Start with a simple implementation and expand based on success.

### 4. Implement Quick Wins
- Enable parallel processing between EVS and nursing
- Pre-position EVS staff during peak discharge hours (11 AM - 3 PM)
- Create direct communication channels (hotline, mobile alerts)

### 5. Scale and Sustain
Follow the 90-day roadmap for systematic improvement across all units.

## Expected Results

Based on implementations at leading health systems:
- **Turnover Time**: Reduce from 180+ to 90 minutes
- **Financial Impact**: $3-5M annual revenue recovery for 300-bed hospital
- **Capacity Gain**: Equivalent to adding 10-15 beds
- **Patient Satisfaction**: 5-10 point improvement
- **ED Boarding**: 20-30% reduction

## Technical Requirements

### For SQL Queries
- SQL Server 2016+ or equivalent
- Access to ADT, EVS, and bed management tables
- Read permissions on relevant schemas

### For Python Scripts
- Python 3.8+
- See `requirements.txt` for package dependencies
- 4GB RAM recommended for large datasets

### For Dashboards
- Tableau 2021.2+ or Power BI (latest)
- Real-time data connection capability
- Mobile device support recommended

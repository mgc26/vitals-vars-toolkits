## Phase 3: Scaled Pilot (Days 31-60)

### Week 5-6: Expanded Deployment
**Target Volume:** 100-150 patients

**Focus Areas:**
- Workflow optimization
- Edge case handling
- Staff burden assessment
- Cost per interaction tracking

### Week 7-8: Process Refinement
**Activities:**
- Implement workflow improvements
- Optimize avatar conversation flows
- Enhance reporting dashboards
- Train additional staff as needed

**Mid-Pilot Review (Day 45):**
- Compare outcomes to baseline
- Calculate preliminary ROI
- Identify scaling barriers
- Decision point: continue/modify/stop

## Phase 4: Full Pilot Operations (Days 61-90)

### Week 9-10: Steady State Operations
**Target Volume:** 200+ patients

**Data Collection Focus:**
- Clinical outcomes vs. control group
- Time savings quantification
- Failure mode analysis
- Patient subgroup performance

### Week 11-12: Evaluation & Planning
**Activities:**
- Comprehensive data analysis
- ROI calculation and validation
- Staff survey and feedback analysis
- Scale planning if successful

### Week 13: Final Assessment
**Deliverables:**
- Executive summary report
- ROI analysis with sensitivity testing
- Recommendation for scale/stop/modify
- Implementation roadmap for expansion

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Patient Selection Criteria
**Inclusion:**
- Diagnosis matching pilot use case
- Cognitive ability to interact
- Access to required technology
- Consent obtained

**Exclusion:**
- Acute psychiatric crisis
- Severe cognitive impairment
- Technology access barriers
- Patient/family refusal

### 2. Safety Protocols
- 24/7 clinical escalation path
- Automatic alerts for concerning responses
- Daily safety huddles first 30 days
- Adverse event reporting system

### 3. Data Collection Requirements
**Minimum Dataset:**
- Patient demographics
- Interaction timestamps and duration
- Completion rates by module
- Patient satisfaction scores
- Clinical outcomes (use case specific)
- Staff time impact
- Technical performance metrics

### 4. Governance Structure
**Pilot Steering Committee:**
- Executive sponsor (Chair)
- Clinical champion
- Nursing representative
- IT/Security lead
- Quality/Safety officer
- Patient representative
- Finance representative

**Meeting Cadence:**
- Weekly: Days 1-30
- Bi-weekly: Days 31-60
- Weekly: Days 61-90

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Insufficient Training:** Minimum 4 hours initial, 2 hours refresher
2. **Poor Patient Selection:** Strictly follow inclusion/exclusion criteria
3. **Weak Change Management:** Over-communicate, celebrate wins
4. **Technical Shortcuts:** Never compromise on integration testing
5. **Inadequate Monitoring:** Daily reviews essential first 30 days

## Measurement Framework

### Clinical Metrics
